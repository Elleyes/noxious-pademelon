#### What skills and concepts did we acquire working on this relational database challenge

- Set up foundational knowledge for working with relational databases
- To better understand how to create or maintaining web applications with persistent storage.
- Learning the differences in using a new SQL client or a library (such as, the Sequelize ORM, pg-promise, or the KnexJS query builder)  over relational databases
- Focus on this core knowledge, will allow working with SQL clients and ORMs to apply in a 'real-world' environment.
- Reinforce conceptual knowledge to emphasize the importance of knowing how to make solid DB design decisions.
- Be able to write SQL queries.
- Design a schema that minimizes redundancy and maximizes reliable and painless access to data.
